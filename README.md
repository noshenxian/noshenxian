# Sean Lee (`noshenxian`)

Cloud-native infrastructure engineer focused on `Kubernetes`, `OpenResty/Nginx`, `WAF`, and automation.

I like turning repeated operations into tools, and turning production problems into reusable engineering patterns.

## Focus Areas

- Cloud-native infrastructure and Kubernetes operations
- OpenResty / Nginx gateway engineering
- WAF and edge security hardening
- Prometheus-based observability setup
- Python automation for daily engineering workflows

## Architecture Keyword Matrix

| Domain | Keywords | What I Usually Work On |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway / Edge | `OpenResty`, `Nginx`, `Lua` | routing, cache policies, request handling, performance tuning |
| Security | `WAF`, `ModSecurity`, rule-based defense | edge protection, policy tuning, operational rollout |
| Cloud Native | `Kubernetes`, `Docker`, `ArgoCD` | deployment workflows, cluster tooling, platform practices |
| Observability | `Prometheus` | quick monitoring stack setup and operational visibility |
| Automation | `Python`, shell scripts | internal tools, repetitive task automation, workflow efficiency |

## Selected Public Projects

- [`openresty-cache`](https://github.com/noshenxian/openresty-cache)  
  Multi-level cache management system built with OpenResty (`Nginx + Lua`), with management capabilities and a visual UI for high-traffic websites / API services.

- [`ucap-waf-openresty`](https://github.com/noshenxian/ucap-waf-openresty)  
  WAF engineering practice based on `OpenResty + ModSecurity`, focused on gateway-layer protection and operability.

- [`ucap-prometheus`](https://github.com/noshenxian/ucap-prometheus)  
  `docker-compose` based Prometheus stack setup for quickly bootstrapping monitoring environments.

- [`k8speixun`](https://github.com/noshenxian/k8speixun)  
  Kubernetes learning/training/practice notes and materials, oriented toward cloud-native onboarding and knowledge consolidation.

- [`work-tools`](https://github.com/noshenxian/work-tools)  
  A collection of work scripts and small tools (mainly `Python`) for efficiency and reducing repetitive work.

## Engineering Style

- Prefer maintainable, observable, and reusable solutions
- Favor standardization and automation over manual operations
- Balance performance, stability, and rollout cost
